Hello , I was selected as a CSR at Kodnest through college. I am interested in the testing domain, hence the need to enhance my skills. I worked on the QAFOX website (a dummy website for software testing) and wrote test cases and executed them.
1. In order to do the following: I have first studied the system and taken a review of how the application works.
2. Understand the flow of the system and try to understand how and which modules are connected to each other.
3. Written test cases, considering positive and negative test scenarios
